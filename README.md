## Learning Tools Built By Students, For Students

## Overview

The Crispus Project (named after Crispus Attucks) is an innovative collaborative platform where recent Master's graduates in computer science and engineering mentor high school and undergraduate students to build AI-powered learning tools. Unlike platforms that simply do homework, we create tools that deepen understanding, foster curiosity, and enhance the learning process.

Our mission is to redefine how students interact with AIâ€”not as a shortcut, but as a powerful lever for intellectual growth.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that:
- Students who want to learn deeply should have access to powerful, personalized tools
- The best learning tools are designed by those who understand the learning process firsthand
- AI should amplify human curiosity and understanding, not replace it
- When given agency and support, students will build remarkable tools for their own education

## How It Works

1. **Matching**: We pair recent Master's graduates with motivated high school and undergraduate students based on interests and complementary skills.

2. **Ideation**: Student teams identify learning challenges or opportunities in their own education that could benefit from AI augmentation.

3. **Building**: With guidance from mentors, students design, build, and iterate on tools using AI, programming, and UX design principles.

4. **Testing**: Tools are tested in real learning environments, refined based on feedback, and shared with the wider Crispus community.

5. **Sharing**: Successful projects are open-sourced and documented for others to use, extend, and learn from.

## Example Projects

- **ConceptGraph**: A visual mapping tool that helps students understand connections between ideas across subjects
- **DeepDive**: An intelligent research assistant that suggests progressively deeper explorations of topics
- **FeedbackLoop**: A writing tool that provides scaffolded feedback rather than corrections
- **TimeTravelMath**: A step-by-step problem solver that reveals mathematical thinking, not just answers
- **DebatePartner**: An AI system that takes multiple perspectives on complex topics to deepen critical thinking

## Get Involved

### For Students
- Passionate about learning and building tools to enhance education
- Basic programming knowledge recommended but not required
- Apply through our website with a brief statement about your learning goals

### For Mentors
- Recent Master's graduates in CS, engineering, or related fields (within last 3 years)
- Interest in education, AI, and mentorship
- Apply with resume and mentorship statement

## Our Sandbox Environment

The Crispus Project provides:
- Development environments and cloud resources
- API access to leading AI models
- Design tools and templates
- Testing frameworks
- Documentation guides
- Community forums and regular workshops

## Community Guidelines

1. **Build for understanding, not shortcuts**: Tools should deepen learning, not circumvent it.
2. **Respect academic integrity**: Projects must align with educational values.
3. **Design for agency**: Empower users to make choices and understand processes.
4. **Documentation matters**: Well-documented projects help others learn from your work.
5. **Collaborate generously**: Share knowledge, offer help, and acknowledge contributions.
