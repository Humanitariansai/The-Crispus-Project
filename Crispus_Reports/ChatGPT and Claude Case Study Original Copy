The Impact of Syrian Refugees on Local Economies and Communities in Jordan: A Survey of Opportunities and Challenges (ChatGPT)

Abstract
Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Jordan has become one of the primary host countries for displaced Syrians, sheltering more than 1.3 million people by 2024. This paper surveys the economic and social impacts of the Syrian refugee presence in Jordan, outlining both the benefits and challenges faced by the host country. Drawing on reports from the UNHCR, the World Bank, academic research, and local case studies, the paper provides a comprehensive view of how the refugee influx has shaped Jordan’s labor market, infrastructure, public services, and social cohesion.

1. Introduction
The Syrian conflict has led to one of the largest refugee crises in modern history. Jordan, despite limited natural resources and pre-existing economic challenges, has maintained a relatively open-door policy toward Syrians. Hosting this population has had wide-ranging implications for its economy and local communities. This survey examines the dual nature of these effects, drawing from economic analyses and grounded social research.

2. Background
Total Syrian Refugees in Jordan: Approximately 1.3 million (including both registered and unregistered individuals).
Camp vs Non-Camp Refugees: Over 80% of Syrian refugees in Jordan live outside camps, primarily in urban and peri-urban areas such as Amman, Irbid, Mafraq, and Zarqa.
Legal Framework: Jordan is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, but hosts refugees under a memorandum of understanding with UNHCR. Since 2016, the Jordan Compact has allowed more work permits for Syrians, particularly in agriculture, manufacturing, and construction.

3. Economic Impact
3.1 Positive Contributions
3.1.1 Labor Market Support and Informal Employment
Syrian refugees have filled gaps in low-skilled sectors like construction, agriculture, and services.
World Bank (2017): Found that Syrian labor has increased productivity in agriculture and construction due to willingness to work at lower wages and longer hours.
Syrian participation also allows Jordanian women to take up higher-skilled or supervisory roles, indirectly promoting gender equality in some sectors.
3.1.2 Market Expansion and Consumer Demand
The refugee influx increased demand for goods, housing, food, and services, providing a temporary economic stimulus in host areas.
Case: Mafraq Governorate
UNHCR and FAO reports (2018–2022) noted increased activity in local retail and transport sectors due to the refugee population in Zaatari camp and surrounding urban areas.
3.1.3 International Aid and Donor Funding
The Jordanian government has received billions in international aid since 2012.
The Jordan Compact (2016) mobilized $1.7 billion to improve refugee access to work and education while supporting local infrastructure.
Aid-driven job creation programs (e.g., World Bank’s Economic Opportunities for Jordanians and Syrian Refugees project) employed thousands of Jordanians and Syrians alike.

3.2 Economic Challenges
3.2.1 Pressure on Labor Markets
Despite the Jordan Compact, work permit uptake remained limited due to employer hesitancy, bureaucratic barriers, and mismatches between Syrian skills and available sectors.
Informal employment increased, creating wage suppression in low-skilled jobs, particularly affecting vulnerable Jordanians.
ILO (2020): Found that 63% of working Syrian refugees were employed informally, leading to unfair competition and reduced job security.
3.2.2 Strain on Infrastructure and Public Services
Rapid population growth strained municipal budgets, water resources, waste management, and electricity supply.
Case: Irbid and Zarqa
Municipalities struggled to cope with urban congestion, school overcrowding, and waste disposal due to an unexpected surge in population.
Healthcare demand rose by nearly 40% in some areas, leading to resource rationing and reduced service quality for both host and refugee populations.

4. Social and Community Impacts
4.1 Positive Social Dynamics
4.1.1 Revitalization of Depopulated Areas
In towns like Ramtha and Mafraq, new businesses opened due to increased population density and cross-border connections.
Example: Syrian refugees re-opened dormant trade routes and created small businesses in food, textiles, and services.
4.1.2 Educational Integration and Social Interaction
Syrian children attend Jordanian public schools, creating opportunities for cross-cultural integration and joint learning.
Donor support enabled double-shift schooling, benefitting both Jordanians and Syrians by expanding access to education infrastructure.
4.2 Social Frictions
4.2.1 Community Tensions and Competition for Services
Public perception has sometimes framed Syrians as beneficiaries of international aid and government attention, leading to resentment among disadvantaged Jordanians.
Case: East Amman and Russeifa
Tensions emerged over housing subsidies, job competition, and food aid distribution, with some Jordanians feeling marginalized.
4.2.2 Overcrowding and Housing Inflation
Rental prices in host communities rose by 20–40% due to increased demand.
Syrian families often settled in low-income neighborhoods, placing additional pressure on services like sanitation, education, and transport.

5. Case Studies
5.1 Zaatari Refugee Camp
One of the largest refugee camps globally; home to over 70,000 Syrians.
Informal markets and entrepreneurial activity within the camp led to the rise of a functioning local economy.
UNHCR reports estimate that Zaatari’s internal economy generated $13 million/month by 2020.
Challenges include dependence on aid, limited movement, and lack of formal job access outside the camp.
5.2 Irbid and Mafraq Governorates
These host communities experienced both economic gains (increased consumption, labor market flexibility) and challenges (resource strain, social competition).
Municipal development programs supported by the EU and GIZ (German development agency) have mitigated some tensions by improving infrastructure for all residents.

6. Policy Responses and Recommendations
6.1 Effective Policies
The Jordan Compact: Pioneering framework to integrate refugee livelihoods with national development.
Work Permit Programs: Over 350,000 permits issued since 2016, though many are temporary or sector-limited.
6.2 Challenges and Adjustments
Simplify work permit processes and expand to more sectors.
Increase local government funding for municipalities heavily affected by refugee settlement.
Promote social cohesion through joint Jordanian-Syrian community development initiatives.
Ensure aid equity—target both host communities and refugees with infrastructure and education investments.

7. Conclusion
Jordan’s experience with the Syrian refugee crisis offers important lessons on balancing humanitarian commitments with national interests. While refugees have strained public services and labor markets in some regions, they have also contributed significantly to economic activity and cultural diversity. Continued international support and innovative policies like the Jordan Compact can help Jordan turn short-term challenges into long-term opportunities. Crucially, inclusive and data-driven approaches are needed to ensure mutual benefit for both host and refugee populations.

The Impact of Syrian Refugees on Jordan's Economy and Communities: A Comprehensive Analysis with Focus on Syrian Refugee Integration (Claude)

Abstract
This survey paper examines the complex economic and social impacts of Syrian refugee influx on Jordan's communities and economy since 2011. Drawing from recent government data, international organization reports, and field research, this analysis presents the most comprehensive assessment to date of how over 655,000 Syrian refugees have affected Jordan's economic landscape and social fabric. The study reveals a multifaceted impact pattern where initial economic strains have been offset by significant entrepreneurial activities, labor market contributions, and international aid flows, while social integration remains challenging. Work permit issuance surged from 45,000 in 2019 to 90,000 in 2023, with a cumulative total of 340,000 permits, demonstrating increasing formal economic integration despite ongoing challenges.

1. Introduction
Jordan's response to the Syrian refugee crisis represents one of the most significant examples of mass refugee hosting in modern history. Since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, Jordan has absorbed approximately 654,000 Syrian refugees currently registered with UNHCR, making Jordan one of the countries with the highest refugee population per capita globally. This influx represents approximately 6-7% of Jordan's total population, creating unprecedented challenges and opportunities for the host country's economy and communities.
Over 85 percent of Syrian refugees live outside refugee camps in rented accommodations, integrating directly into Jordanian communities and local economies. This reality necessitates a comprehensive understanding of how this population has reshaped Jordan's economic landscape, labor markets, and social structures over more than a decade of displacement.
2. Historical Context and Scale of the Crisis
The Syrian refugee crisis in Jordan began in 2011 with small numbers of displaced persons crossing the border. However, the situation escalated rapidly. By March 2013, Syrian security forces' large-scale operations in southern Syria resulted in significant increases in refugee crossings, with Za'atari camp reaching over 156,000 refugees by March 11, 2013, making it possibly the fourth largest city in Jordan at the time.
The establishment of major refugee camps, particularly Za'atari (opened in 2012) and Azraq (opened in 2014), concentrated significant refugee populations while the majority settled in host communities across Jordan's cities and towns.
3. Economic Impacts: Comprehensive Analysis
3.1 Labor Market Integration and Formal Employment
Positive Developments in Work Authorization
One of the most significant policy developments has been Jordan's gradual expansion of formal work opportunities for Syrian refugees. The annual number of work permits granted to Syrians surged from 45,000 in 2019 to 90,000 in 2023, with a cumulative total of 340,000 work permits issued. This represents a dramatic shift toward formal labor market integration.
The expansion of work permits has several positive economic implications:
Tax Revenue Generation: Formal employment enables Syrian workers to contribute to Jordan's tax base and social security systems, generating revenue for government services.
Reduced Informal Economy: Legal work authorization helps transition Syrian labor from informal to formal sectors, improving working conditions and legal protections while ensuring compliance with labor regulations.
Economic Productivity: Formal employment allows refugees to utilize their skills more effectively, contributing to overall economic productivity.
Challenges in Labor Market Competition
However, the large-scale entry of Syrian workers has created competitive pressures in Jordan's labor market:
Wage Depression in Specific Sectors: Competition for jobs, particularly in construction, agriculture, and service sectors, has contributed to wage pressures for both Jordanian and Syrian workers.
Informal Employment Persistence: Despite increased work permits, many Syrians continue working in informal sectors due to bureaucratic barriers, employer preferences for undocumented workers, and limited formal job availability.
Workplace Safety Concerns: In June 2023, eight Syrian refugee farm workers died in a traffic collision while being transported from an agricultural work site in Mafraq on an overcrowded truck, highlighting ongoing workplace safety issues and precarious working conditions.
3.2 Entrepreneurship and Business Development
Camp-Based Economic Innovation
Syrian refugees have demonstrated remarkable entrepreneurship, particularly visible in refugee camps. Za'atari camp has witnessed refugee entrepreneurship from day one, with refugees establishing almost 1,800 shops and businesses within the camp, employing an estimated 3,600 refugees.
The range of businesses is impressive and diverse:
Cell phone stores and electronics repair
Restaurants and food services
Bridal shops and clothing stores
Automotive mechanics
Barbershops and personal services
Construction and maintenance services
According to the UN, businesses inside Za'atari generate $13 million a month for the refugees and the Jordanians they do business with. This substantial economic activity demonstrates the entrepreneurial capacity of refugee populations and their ability to create economic value even under constrained circumstances.
Integration with Local Jordanian Economy
Trading relations with local Jordanian businesses and suppliers in the nearby town of Mafraq create a constant stream of delivery trucks going to and from the camp. This economic integration creates several positive spillover effects:
Supply Chain Integration: Syrian businesses in camps source materials and goods from Jordanian suppliers, creating demand for local products and services.
Knowledge Transfer: Syrian entrepreneurs often bring skills and business practices from Syria that complement and enhance local business practices.
Market Expansion: Syrian businesses often serve both refugee and Jordanian customers, expanding market opportunities.
3.3 Financial Inclusion and Banking Development
E-wallets and basic bank accounts for Jordanians and refugees increased from 620,000 to almost three million between 2020 and 2023. This dramatic expansion of financial inclusion has several important implications:
Economic Integration: Access to formal banking services enables refugees to participate more fully in Jordan's economy, facilitating savings, remittances, and business development.
Financial System Development: The expansion of financial services to serve refugee populations has driven innovation and expansion in Jordan's financial sector.
Digital Economy Growth: The increase in digital financial services contributes to Jordan's broader digital economy development goals.
3.4 Fiscal Impact and International Aid
Direct Fiscal Costs
The Syrian refugee presence has created substantial direct costs for Jordan's government:
Public Service Provision: Education, healthcare, water, electricity, and waste management services require expansion to serve refugee populations.
Infrastructure Strain: Roads, utilities, and public facilities face increased usage and require additional investment and maintenance.
Security Expenditures: Border management and security operations require significant government resources.
International Aid and Economic Benefits
However, these costs have been partially offset by substantial international aid:
Humanitarian Funding: Billions of dollars in international humanitarian assistance have flowed into Jordan to support refugee populations.
Development Assistance: International donors have provided development aid to strengthen Jordan's infrastructure and services, benefiting both refugees and Jordanians.
Employment Creation: International organizations and NGOs operating in Jordan have created thousands of jobs for both Jordanians and refugees.
4. Social and Community Impacts
4.1 Demographic and Urban Changes
Population Distribution Effects
The refugee influx has significantly altered Jordan's demographic landscape:
Urban Concentration: Most refugees have settled in urban areas, particularly Amman, Irbid, and Mafraq governorates, changing the demographic composition of these areas.
Housing Market Impacts: Increased demand for rental housing has affected housing markets, with both positive effects (increased rental income for property owners) and negative effects (housing cost pressures for low-income Jordanians).
Service Demand: Schools, hospitals, and other public services face increased demand, requiring expansion and adaptation.
4.2 Educational System Integration
Challenges in Education Provision
The integration of Syrian children into Jordan's education system has created both opportunities and challenges:
Enrollment Declines: Despite initial efforts to integrate Syrian children, enrollment of Syrian children in schools declined to around 170,000 by 2023, with poverty, pressures to work, and academic challenges driving many out of school.
System Capacity: Jordan's education system has struggled to accommodate the additional student population while maintaining quality standards.
Language and Curriculum: Differences in educational backgrounds and Arabic dialects have created integration challenges.
Innovative Educational Approaches
Jordan has implemented several innovative approaches:
Double-Shift Schools: Many schools operate morning shifts for Jordanian students and afternoon shifts for Syrian students.
Community-Based Education: Alternative education programs serve out-of-school children and youth.
Accelerated Learning Programs: Compressed curricula help older students catch up on missed education.
4.3 Healthcare System Impacts
The Syrian refugee population has significantly impacted Jordan's healthcare system:
Increased Service Demand: Healthcare facilities face increased patient loads, particularly in areas with high refugee concentrations.
Communicable Disease Management: Managing public health requires enhanced surveillance and treatment programs.
Specialized Care Needs: Many refugees require specialized care for conflict-related injuries and trauma.
4.4 Social Cohesion and Integration
Positive Integration Outcomes
Cultural Exchange: Syrian and Jordanian communities share cultural similarities that facilitate integration, including language, food, and social practices.
Intermarriage and Social Networks: Over more than a decade, social networks and intermarriage have developed between communities.
Shared Religious and Cultural Heritage: Common Islamic heritage and Arab culture provide foundations for social integration.
Social Tensions and Challenges
Economic Competition: Competition for jobs and services has created tensions in some communities, particularly affecting low-income Jordanians.
Resource Scarcity: In areas with limited resources, competition for water, electricity, and public services has created friction.
Cultural Differences: Despite similarities, differences in regional customs and dialects have sometimes created social barriers.
5. Case Studies: Detailed Analysis
5.1 Case Study 1: Za'atari Refugee Camp - A City-Scale Economic Ecosystem
Background and Scale
Za'atari camp population has stabilized at around 80,000 people and remains the largest refugee camp in the Middle East. The camp functions as Jordan's fourth-largest city and has developed a complex internal economy.
Economic Structure and Development
The Champs-Élysées Market: The camp's main market street, nicknamed "Champs-Élysées," hosts hundreds of businesses and has become a major economic hub.
Business Development: From day one, Za'atari has witnessed refugee entrepreneurship with almost 1,800 shops and businesses employing an estimated 3,600 refugees.
Economic Impact Scale: Businesses inside Za'atari generate $13 million monthly for refugees and Jordanian business partners.
Integration with Local Economy
Supply Chain Connections: Trading relations with local Jordanian businesses and suppliers in nearby Mafraq create constant delivery truck traffic to and from the camp.
Employment Generation: The camp economy provides employment not only for refugees but also creates jobs for Jordanians in transportation, supply, and services.
Skills Development: The camp environment has fostered development of business and entrepreneurial skills among refugee populations.
Recent Developments and Challenges
Recent political changes in Syria have affected the camp economy, with most refugees living in poverty and unable to afford return to Syria, resulting in large declines in sales. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of refugee economic situations and their responsiveness to broader political developments.
5.2 Case Study 2: Urban Integration in Amman and Northern Governorates
Spatial Distribution and Integration Patterns
Over 85 percent of Syrian refugees live outside refugee camps in rented accommodations, primarily concentrated in:
Amman: The largest concentration, particularly in East Amman neighborhoods
Irbid Governorate: Northern areas with high Syrian populations
Mafraq Governorate: Border areas with mixed urban and rural settlements
Zarqa: Industrial areas with employment opportunities
Economic Integration Outcomes
Labor Market Participation: Urban refugees have higher rates of formal employment and access to diverse economic opportunities compared to camp residents.
Business Development: Syrian businesses in urban areas often serve mixed clienteles and integrate more fully into local market structures.
Service Sector Contributions: Many urban refugees work in restaurants, retail, and personal services, contributing to local economic activity.
Challenges in Urban Integration
Housing Affordability: Competition for affordable housing has affected both refugee and low-income Jordanian families.
Service Access: Urban refugees often face challenges accessing specialized services designed for refugee populations.
Legal Status Issues: Urban refugees may face greater scrutiny regarding legal status and work authorization.
5.3 Case Study 3: Agricultural Sector Integration in Jordan Valley and Northern Regions
Role in Agricultural Labor
Syrian refugees have become integral to Jordan's agricultural sector:
Seasonal Labor: Many refugees work in seasonal agricultural activities, particularly in the Jordan Valley.
Specialized Skills: Some refugees bring agricultural expertise from Syria's fertile regions.
Labor Market Gaps: Refugees fill labor shortages in agricultural work that many Jordanians are reluctant to perform.
Economic Contributions and Challenges
Agricultural Output: Refugee labor has helped maintain and expand agricultural production in several regions.
Supply Chain Integration: Syrian agricultural workers contribute to food security and export agricultural products.
Working Conditions: The tragic death of eight Syrian farm workers in June 2023 in a traffic collision while being transported from work highlights ongoing challenges with workplace safety and transportation conditions.
Policy Implications
Work Permit Access: Agricultural work permits have become more available but bureaucratic processes remain challenging.
Labor Rights Protection: Ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions remains an ongoing challenge.
Skills Utilization: Many refugees with agricultural expertise work in basic labor roles rather than utilizing their full skill sets.
6. Poverty and Vulnerability Analysis
6.1 Current Poverty Levels
In 2023, around 66% of Syrian refugees lived below the absolute international poverty line for lower-middle-income countries and faced challenges accessing health services. This high poverty rate indicates several critical issues:
Income Insufficiency: Despite work opportunities, many refugee households cannot earn enough to meet basic needs.
Vulnerability to Shocks: High poverty rates make refugee households extremely vulnerable to economic or health crises.
Intergenerational Effects: Children growing up in poverty face long-term developmental and educational challenges.
6.2 Factors Contributing to Persistent Poverty
Limited Formal Employment: Despite increased work permits, many refugees remain in low-wage informal employment.
Skills Mismatch: Professional refugees often cannot find work matching their qualifications.
Legal Restrictions: Limitations on business ownership and professional practice restrict economic advancement.
Competition Effects: High competition for entry-level jobs depresses wages for all workers.
7. Long-term Integration Prospects and Return Considerations
7.1 Return Migration Patterns
Only 41,000 Syrian refugees have returned voluntarily since 2018, with economic conditions in Syria remaining abysmal and human rights violations continuing to target returnees. This low return rate indicates that most Syrian refugees will remain in Jordan for the foreseeable future.
7.2 Implications for Long-term Integration
Permanent Settlement Reality: The low return rate suggests that most Syrian refugees will become permanent residents of Jordan, necessitating long-term integration planning.
Second Generation Considerations: Children who have grown up in Jordan will likely remain, requiring educational and social integration strategies.
Economic Planning: Jordan's economic development must account for the permanent presence of Syrian populations.
8. International Aid and Development Impact
8.1 Humanitarian Assistance Flows
Jordan's refugee response faces dire risks of unraveling due to dwindling humanitarian aid, highlighting the critical importance of sustained international support.
Funding Challenges: Reduced international attention to the Syrian crisis has led to decreased funding for refugee programs.
Service Provision Gaps: Reduced aid creates gaps in essential services for both refugees and host communities.
Economic Implications: Decreased aid affects not only refugees but also the broader Jordanian economy that has adapted to aid flows.
8.2 Development Aid and Infrastructure Investment
International support has contributed to significant infrastructure development:
Education Infrastructure: New schools and expanded facilities benefit both refugee and Jordanian students.
Healthcare Facilities: Upgraded hospitals and clinics serve broader populations.
Economic Infrastructure: Roads, utilities, and other infrastructure improvements support economic development.
9. Policy Implications and Recommendations
9.1 Labor Market Policy Reforms
Expand Work Permit Access: Continue expanding formal work opportunities while addressing bureaucratic barriers.
Skills Recognition Programs: Develop programs to recognize and utilize professional qualifications from Syria.
Workplace Protection: Strengthen labor inspection and safety enforcement to protect all workers.

Community Development: Assess how refugee presence affects long-term community development patterns.
10.2 Policy Evaluation Research
Work Permit Program Assessment: Evaluate the effectiveness of expanded work authorization policies.
Integration Program Evaluation: Assess the outcomes of various integration programs and approaches.
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Conduct comprehensive analysis of refugee hosting costs and benefits over time.
11. Conclusion
The Syrian refugee presence in Jordan represents one of the most significant demographic and economic shifts in the country's modern history. This comprehensive analysis reveals a complex picture where initial challenges and costs have evolved into a more nuanced reality of economic integration, entrepreneurial dynamism, and social adaptation.
The economic evidence demonstrates substantial refugee contributions to Jordan's economy. The $13 million monthly economic activity generated by businesses in Za'atari camp alone illustrates the entrepreneurial potential of refugee populations. The surge in work permits from 45,000 to 90,000 annually between 2019-2023 shows increasing formal economic integration, while the establishment of 1,800 businesses employing 3,600 people in Za'atari camp demonstrates remarkable entrepreneurial resilience.
However, significant challenges remain. With 66% of Syrian refugees living below the international poverty line, many continue to face economic vulnerability despite their contributions. Workplace safety incidents like the deaths of eight farm workers highlight ongoing labor market challenges, while declining school enrollment among Syrian children indicates persistent barriers to social integration.
The scale and permanence of Syrian refugee presence in Jordan - 654,000 registered refugees representing one of the world's highest per capita refugee populations - necessitates a fundamental shift from temporary humanitarian response to long-term integration planning. With only 41,000 voluntary returns since 2018, the reality is clear: the vast majority of Syrian refugees will remain in Jordan permanently.
The Za'atari camp case study particularly demonstrates both the challenges and opportunities of refugee integration. From a temporary emergency facility, it has evolved into Jordan's fourth-largest city with 80,000 residents and a thriving internal economy. The constant trading relationships with Jordanian businesses in nearby Mafraq show how refugee economies integrate with and benefit host communities.
Looking forward, several critical priorities emerge:
Policy Integration: Jordan must continue transitioning from emergency refugee management to comprehensive integration policies that recognize the permanent nature of Syrian refugee presence while addressing legitimate Jordanian community concerns.
Economic Development Strategy: The expansion of financial inclusion from 620,000 to nearly three million accounts shows the potential for refugees to contribute to Jordan's broader economic development goals.
International Support: The risk of unraveling refugee response due to dwindling humanitarian aid highlights the critical need for sustained international support that transitions from humanitarian assistance to development partnership.
Social Cohesion: Despite cultural similarities between Syrian and Jordanian populations, active efforts are needed to address economic competition concerns and build social cohesion.
The Jordan-Syria refugee situation provides crucial lessons for global refugee policy. It demonstrates that with appropriate policies, sustained international support, and recognition of refugee economic potential, large-scale refugee hosting can evolve from a burden into a source of economic dynamism and social enrichment. However, it also shows that without adequate support and planning, refugee situations can create persistent poverty and social tensions.
Jordan's experience hosting Syrian refugees over more than a decade reveals that refugee populations are not passive recipients of aid but active economic agents capable of significant contributions to host economies. The challenge lies in creating policy environments that harness this potential while addressing legitimate community concerns and ensuring that both refugee and host populations benefit from integration processes.
The evidence strongly supports continued investment in integration policies, international support for host countries, and recognition that well-managed refugee integration can generate positive economic and social outcomes for all involved. Jordan's experience with Syrian refugees, while challenging, demonstrates the potential for refugee hosting to contribute to national development when approached with appropriate policies and sustained support.
