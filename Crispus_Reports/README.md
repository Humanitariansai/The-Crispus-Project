# Tips for High Schoolers Creating Great Reports Using AI

I'd be happy to provide some tips for high schoolers on how to effectively use AI for report creation. Here's a summary of best practices:

## Core Strategies

1. **Use AI as a research assistant, not a replacement**
   - Have AI help identify relevant sources and information
   - Use AI to suggest search terms for deeper research
   - Ask AI to explain complex concepts in simpler terms

2. **Improve your prompting skills**
   - Be specific about what you need (format, length, audience, purpose)
   - Break complex topics into smaller, focused questions
   - Request explanations in age-appropriate language

3. **Verify information from AI**
   - Cross-check facts from multiple sources
   - Look for primary sources when possible
   - Be cautious of information about very recent events

4. **Use AI for brainstorming and outlining**
   - Generate potential thesis statements or research questions
   - Create structured outlines before writing
   - Explore different perspectives on your topic

5. **Enhance rather than replace your writing**
   - Draft your own ideas first
   - Use AI to help refine your language and structure
   - Ask AI for feedback on clarity and organization

6. **Disclose AI usage appropriately**
   - Follow your school's guidelines on AI use
   - Be transparent about how AI assisted your work
   - Maintain academic integrity by doing substantive work yourself

7. **Use AI for formatting and citations**
   - Get help with proper citation formats
   - Check grammar and spelling
   - Format bibliographies correctly

## Regarding the Case Study on Syrian Refugees

The document you shared is a comprehensive case study examining the economic impact of Syrian refugees on Jordan's labor market. It explores how the massive influx of refugees following the Syrian civil war affected employment rates, wages, and labor market segmentation in Jordan.

Key findings include:
- Contrary to common fears, the refugee influx had minimal aggregate impact on employment for Jordanian nationals
- Pre-existing labor market segmentation meant refugees primarily competed with other migrants rather than Jordanians
- Distributional effects were important - some vulnerable groups faced more competition
- Policy frameworks significantly shaped economic integration outcomes

This case study would be excellent material for a high school report on refugee economics, migration impacts, or humanitarian policy. When using AI to help with such complex material, students should focus on having the AI explain unfamiliar economic concepts, help organize the key findings, and suggest additional research questions to explore.
