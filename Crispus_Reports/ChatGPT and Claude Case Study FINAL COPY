The Impact of Syrian Refugees on Jordan’s Economy and Communities: Challenges, Opportunities, and Paths to Integration
Abstract
Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Jordan has become one of the foremost host countries for displaced Syrians, sheltering approximately 1.4 million refugees by 2024. This comprehensive study combines findings from academic research, field studies, international agency reports, and Jordanian policy analysis to explore the multifaceted impact of the refugee presence on the kingdom’s economy and social fabric. While the refugee influx placed significant strain on labor markets, infrastructure, and public services, it also introduced labor market flexibility, entrepreneurial activity, and spurred financial and international development support. The report emphasizes the urgent need for long-term integration planning, equitable aid distribution, and sustained international cooperation.
1. Introduction
Jordan’s response to the Syrian refugee crisis is one of the most notable examples of large-scale refugee hosting in the modern era. By 2024, Syrian refugees constituted about 6–7% of Jordan's population. While the country has shown humanitarian commitment under difficult circumstances, the presence of a large refugee population has deeply reshaped its labor market, urban planning, public services, and social dynamics. Over 85% of Syrians in Jordan live outside refugee camps, directly integrating into urban communities such as Amman, Irbid, Mafraq, and Zarqa. This reality demands nuanced policy approaches balancing immediate humanitarian needs with long-term development and integration goals.
2. Historical Context and Scope
The refugee influx escalated rapidly after 2011. Za’atari camp, established in 2012, reached over 156,000 refugees at its peak in 2013. Over time, the population of camps like Za’atari (now around 80,000) and Azraq stabilized, while the vast majority of refugees settled in urban and peri-urban areas. Jordan hosts both registered and unregistered Syrians under a Memorandum of Understanding with UNHCR and the Jordan Compact (2016), which facilitated access to work permits in selected sectors.
3. Economic Impacts
3.1 Labor Market Dynamics
Formal Integration: By 2023, over 360,000 work permits had been issued to Syrian refugees. This formalization process reduced reliance on the informal sector, improved labor protections, and generated tax revenues.
Challenges: Many Syrians still work informally—63% as of 2020—due to bureaucratic obstacles, skill mismatches, and employer hesitancy. Competition for low-skilled jobs, particularly in construction, agriculture, and services, has led to wage suppression affecting both refugee and vulnerable Jordanian workers.
Safety Concerns: Incidents such as the 2023 truck crash in Mafraq, which killed eight Syrian farmworkers, highlighted ongoing risks related to transport and workplace safety.
3.2 Entrepreneurship and Market Activity
Refugees demonstrated significant entrepreneurial capacity, particularly in Za’atari camp where over 1,800 shops generate approximately $13 million monthly.
In urban areas, Syrian-owned businesses operate in food, retail, and services, stimulating local economies and integrating with Jordanian supply chains.
Syrian entrepreneurship has revitalized depopulated areas and fostered economic linkages, particularly with local vendors in Mafraq and Irbid.
3.3 Financial Inclusion
The number of Jordanians and refugees using e-wallets and basic bank accounts surged from 620,000 in 2020 to nearly 3 million in 2023.
Financial inclusion supports economic resilience, enables savings and remittances, and stimulates Jordan’s digital economy.
3.4 Infrastructure and Fiscal Burden
Refugees have increased demand for public utilities, education, health care, housing, and waste management.
Host municipalities such as Irbid and Zarqa face urban congestion and overburdened services.
These costs have been partially offset by international support, including over $1.7 billion through the Jordan Compact and continued development aid from the EU, World Bank, and UN agencies.
4. Social and Community Impacts
4.1 Urban Integration and Demographics
The population surge altered the demographic composition of cities, increased rental prices by 20–40%, and contributed to overcrowding in housing, schools, and clinics.
Syrian refugees often settled in low-income areas, straining local infrastructure and intensifying competition for services.
4.2 Education System Pressures
Syrian children are enrolled in public schools, often through double-shift systems.
However, school dropout rates remain high, with only 170,000 Syrian children enrolled by 2023.
Contributing factors include poverty, child labor, language barriers, and academic gaps.
4.3 Healthcare System Strain
Healthcare demand rose by over 40% in some regions.
Challenges include managing communicable diseases, trauma-related care, and maintaining quality in overstretched facilities.
4.4 Social Cohesion
Positive Dynamics: Cultural similarities, intermarriage, and shared religion have aided integration.
Tensions: In cities like East Amman and Russeifa, competition for aid, jobs, and housing sparked local resentment.
Targeted aid distribution is essential to prevent the perception of favoritism and promote equitable development.
5. Case Studies
5.1 Za’atari Refugee Camp
Population: Stabilized at ~80,000.
Economy: Nearly 1,800 businesses operate in the camp, employing 3,600 people and generating $13 million/month.
Integration: Close trading relationships with Mafraq businesses benefit both refugees and locals.
Challenges: Many residents remain dependent on aid; sales have declined due to poverty and low purchasing power.
5.2 Urban Integration in Amman, Irbid, Mafraq, and Zarqa
Refugees living outside camps experience greater employment opportunities but face higher competition for housing and legal work authorization.
Syrian-owned businesses serve diverse customer bases and are embedded in local economies.
5.3 Agricultural Sector in Jordan Valley
Syrian refugees are essential to seasonal agricultural labor, particularly in northern regions.
Despite their skills, many are underemployed and face harsh working conditions, unsafe transportation, and limited upward mobility.
6. Poverty and Vulnerability
As of 2023, 66% of Syrian refugees in Jordan lived below the international poverty line.
Factors include low wages, informal employment, restricted access to skilled professions, and limited business rights.
Vulnerability to economic shocks and intergenerational poverty remains a significant risk.
7. Long-Term Integration and Return Prospects
Only ~41,000 Syrians have returned voluntarily since 2018, suggesting that the majority will remain in Jordan long-term.
Second-generation refugees are growing up within Jordanian society, requiring inclusive education and employment planning.
The policy shift must recognize this permanence and incorporate refugees into national development strategies.
8. International Aid and Development Impact
Humanitarian Assistance: Billions have supported refugee services but are declining, threatening service continuity.
Development Aid: Investments in schools, hospitals, roads, and financial systems have benefited both host and refugee communities.
Continued donor engagement is essential to sustain stability and progress.
9. Policy Recommendations
9.1 Labor and Economic Policy
Simplify and expand work permit processes across more sectors.
Recognize Syrian qualifications and improve job matching.
Enforce labor rights and ensure workplace safety.
Expand entrepreneurship programs with access to finance.
9.2 Social Integration
Invest in inclusive education infrastructure and teacher capacity.
Support community initiatives that foster cross-cultural interaction.
Design cultural and media programs promoting mutual understanding.
9.3 Economic Development Strategy
Leverage refugee labor to revitalize underdeveloped regions.
Support joint Syrian-Jordanian business ventures and export initiatives.
Use financial inclusion tools to increase economic mobility.
9.4 International Cooperation
Establish long-term burden-sharing frameworks.
Transition from humanitarian to development aid.
Promote regional economic strategies to stabilize displacement impacts.
10. Conclusion
Jordan’s experience hosting Syrian refugees illustrates both the challenges of large-scale displacement and the potential for refugees to contribute positively to national development. While the economic burden on public services and labor markets is real, the evidence shows significant entrepreneurial contributions, formal labor integration, and cultural adaptability. The Za’atari camp’s transformation into an economic micro-city, the growth in work permit uptake, and financial inclusion successes highlight this potential.
Yet, sustained poverty among refugees, social tensions in host communities, and declining international support jeopardize long-term stability. Jordan’s approach must now shift from emergency response to structured integration—backed by international development partnerships and inclusive policies. If managed effectively, refugee integration can evolve from a crisis response into a model for inclusive economic growth and social cohesion.
