# Case Study: Syrian Refugees and the Jordanian Labor Market (Example-Not used in the actual project)

## 1. Introduction

The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, triggered one of the largest refugee crises in modern history. Jordan, sharing a border with Syria, became a primary destination for those fleeing the conflict. By 2015, Jordan hosted approximately 1.3 million Syrian refugees, representing nearly 20% of Jordan's pre-crisis population (Department of Statistics Jordan, 2015). This massive and sudden demographic shift presented significant challenges for Jordan's economy, particularly its labor market.

This case study examines the economic impact of Syrian refugees on Jordan's labor market, with particular focus on employment rates, wage effects, and labor market segmentation. It presents empirical evidence that challenges common assumptions about refugee impacts while highlighting nuanced distributional effects across different sectors and demographic groups.

## 2. Context: Jordan's Economy and Labor Market Structure

### 2.1 Pre-Crisis Economic Landscape

Prior to the Syrian refugee crisis, Jordan already faced significant economic challenges:

- High unemployment rates (12.5% in 2010)
- Large informal sector (estimated at 44% of non-agricultural employment)
- Heavy reliance on foreign aid and remittances
- Structural labor market segmentation

Jordan's labor market was characterized by several distinct segments:
- A public sector employing primarily Jordanian nationals
- A formal private sector with a mix of Jordanian and migrant workers
- An informal sector dominated by migrant workers from Egypt and other countries
- Sectors with explicit labor nationalization policies (e.g., certain professional services)

### 2.2 Scale and Distribution of Syrian Refugee Influx

The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan occurred in several waves, with the most significant numbers arriving between 2012 and 2014. Key characteristics of this population movement included:

- By 2015, the Syrian working-age population in Jordan reached approximately 644,000, representing about 16% of Jordan's working-age population (Fallah et al., 2019)
- Geographic concentration in northern governorates (Mafraq, Irbid) and urban centers (Amman, Zarqa)
- Predominantly young population with higher proportion of female-headed households
- Low official labor force participation (45% for men, 4% for women)

## 3. Initial Policy Response and Labor Market Access

### 3.1 Initial Restrictions on Formal Employment

Unlike some refugee-hosting countries, Jordan initially prohibited Syrian refugees from formal employment:

- Until 2016, Syrians were officially barred from obtaining work permits
- This policy created a de facto expansion of the informal labor market
- Many Syrians worked illegally, primarily in construction, agriculture, and service sectors
- The lack of legal status exposed refugees to exploitation and precarious working conditions

### 3.2 The Jordan Compact (2016)

A turning point came with the Jordan Compact, an agreement between the Jordanian government and international donors announced at the London Conference in February 2016. Key elements included:

- Commitment to issue up to 200,000 work permits for Syrian refugees
- Focus on specific sectors: agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and food service
- Trade concessions from the European Union to boost exports from designated Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
- $1.7 billion in grants and concessional loans from international donors

This represented a significant policy shift from treating Syrian refugees as a humanitarian challenge to viewing them as potential economic contributors.

## 4. Empirical Evidence on Labor Market Impacts

### 4.1 Overall Employment Effects for Jordanians

Multiple empirical studies have investigated the impact of Syrian refugees on employment outcomes for Jordanian nationals. The evidence consistently points to minimal aggregate effects:

- Fallah et al. (2019) used panel data from 2010 to 2016 combined with geographical variation in refugee concentration to identify impacts. They found that "Jordanians living in areas with high concentrations of refugees have had no worse labor market outcomes than Jordanians with less exposure to the refugee influx."

- Fakih and Ibrahim (2016) employed vector autoregressive methodology on time series data from the most affected governorates and found "no relationship between the influx of Syrian refugees and the Jordanian labor market" for overall unemployment and employment rates.

These findings contradict initial fears that the massive influx would significantly increase unemployment among Jordanians.

### 4.2 Wage Effects and Labor Market Adjustments

While overall employment levels remained relatively stable, some wage effects were observed:

- Fallah et al. (2019) found that Jordanian workers in areas with high refugee concentrations experienced a significant increase in hourly wages (though not in monthly wages), suggesting changes in working hours rather than wage rates.

- The International Labour Organization (ILO, 2015) documented downward pressure on wages in the informal sector, particularly in construction and agriculture, where Syrian refugees concentrated.

- However, these wage effects were primarily limited to sectors with high informality and those already dominated by migrant labor before the crisis.

### 4.3 Distributional Effects and Vulnerable Groups

Despite minimal aggregate impacts, important distributional effects emerged:

- Malaeb and Wahba (2018) found that non-Syrian immigrants in Jordan were more negatively affected than Jordanian nationals. They documented that "male immigrants were more likely to be underemployed (i.e., work in the informal sector, work fewer hours, and earn lower monthly wages) in areas with high concentration of Syrian refugees."

- Less-educated Jordanians and those previously employed in the informal sector experienced more competition, while more educated Jordanians sometimes benefited from occupational upgrading and increased formalization.

- Women's labor market participation, already low in Jordan, faced additional pressure in some communities due to increased competition and cultural factors.

### 4.4 Sectoral Impacts and Economic Adjustments

The impact varied significantly across economic sectors:

- Construction and agriculture saw the largest influx of Syrian workers, leading to wage depression and displacement of some existing migrant workers (particularly Egyptians).

- Retail and service sectors expanded in areas with high refugee concentrations, creating some new employment opportunities.

- Public sector employment for Jordanians increased, partly as a response to the refugee crisis and associated international aid.

## 5. Explanatory Factors for Limited Labor Market Impacts

Several factors help explain why the massive influx of refugees did not lead to the expected negative labor market outcomes:

### 5.1 Labor Market Segmentation

Jordan's labor market was already highly segmented prior to the crisis:

- Syrian refugees primarily competed with other migrants in the informal sector rather than with Jordanian nationals.
- Formal employment was largely protected for Jordanians through licensing requirements, public sector hiring, and administrative barriers.
- Fallah et al. (2019) note: "The number of non-Syrian immigrants in Jordan has not decreased in the same period, and Syrians mainly compete with economic immigrants in the informal sector."

### 5.2 Low Labor Force Participation

Despite the large number of Syrian refugees, their actual labor market participation remained relatively low:

- By 2016, the Syrian labor force was equivalent to only about 9% of the Jordanian labor force (Fallah et al., 2019).
- Cultural factors and household responsibilities limited women's participation.
- Uncertainty about legal status and fear of consequences discouraged formal work-seeking behavior.

### 5.3 International Aid and Economic Stimulus

International assistance partially offset potential negative impacts:

- Humanitarian aid created new jobs in service delivery and administration.
- Infrastructure investments to accommodate refugees generated construction employment.
- The Jordan Compact brought significant new funding for economic development.

### 5.4 Expansion of Public Sector Employment

The Jordanian government increased public sector hiring, partly in response to the crisis:

- Fallah et al. (2019) observed "a shift in employment from the private to the public sector" in areas with high refugee concentrations.
- Increased demand for public services, particularly education and health, led to government hiring of Jordanian nationals.

## 6. Challenges in the Implementation of the Jordan Compact

Despite the ambitious goals of the Jordan Compact, its implementation faced significant challenges:

### 6.1 Work Permit Uptake

The issuance of work permits fell far short of targets:

- By the end of 2017, only 87,141 work permits had been issued to Syrians out of the targeted 200,000 (Joint Data Center, 2019).
- Barriers included complex bureaucratic procedures, employer reluctance, and refugee concerns about losing humanitarian assistance.

### 6.2 Sectoral Limitations

The sectoral approach limited economic integration:

- Work permits were restricted to sectors already dominated by migrant workers.
- Skilled and educated Syrians could not legally work in their professions.
- Many Syrians lacked experience in the designated sectors (agriculture, construction).

### 6.3 Special Economic Zones Challenges

The SEZ component of the Compact faced implementation difficulties:

- Companies struggled to meet the requirement of employing 15% Syrian refugees.
- Transportation challenges made it difficult for refugees to reach SEZs.
- The business model faced fundamental viability challenges.

## 7. Long-term Impacts and Adaptation (2016-2023)

Over time, both policy frameworks and economic adaptations evolved:

### 7.1 Policy Evolution

The Jordanian government gradually modified its approach:

- Work permit requirements were simplified in some sectors.
- Home-based business regulations were adjusted to allow refugee participation.
- Temporary programs during COVID-19 allowed Syrian medical professionals to work legally.

### 7.2 Economic Adaptation

The Jordanian economy showed signs of adaptation:

- Some areas with high refugee concentrations developed new economic niches.
- Entrepreneurship among both refugees and hosts created new market opportunities.
- Labor market segmentation evolved rather than dissolved, with Syrians establishing specific economic roles.

### 7.3 Persistent Challenges

Despite adaptations, significant challenges remained:

- High overall unemployment, particularly among youth.
- Continued vulnerability and poverty among refugee populations.
- Dependency on international assistance that gradually declined over time.

## 8. Lessons Learned

The Jordanian experience offers several important lessons for understanding refugee impacts on labor markets:

### 8.1 Importance of Labor Market Structure

Pre-existing labor market structures significantly influence how refugee inflows affect outcomes:

- Segmented labor markets often channel refugees into specific sectors, limiting competition with nationals.
- Formal/informal divides shape integration patterns and distributional impacts.
- Policy restrictions on refugee employment do not prevent labor market impacts but may channel them into informal sectors.

### 8.2 Distributional Effects Matter

While aggregate impacts may be minimal, distributional effects are critical:

- Vulnerable groups within host communities often bear disproportionate costs.
- Other migrant workers may face more direct competition than nationals.
- Benefits and costs are unevenly distributed across geography, sectors, and skill levels.

### 8.3 Policy Frameworks Shape Outcomes

Government policies significantly influence economic integration outcomes:

- Work permit systems must address practical barriers to uptake.
- Sectoral approaches should consider refugee skills and market demands.
- Complementary policies addressing housing, transportation, and social services are essential.

### 8.4 Economic Integration is Multidimensional

Successful integration requires attention to multiple factors:

- Legal frameworks determine formal opportunities but informal adaptations also matter.
- Spatial factors (housing, transportation) significantly affect employment access.
- Social networks and information channels shape labor market outcomes.

## 9. Conclusion

The Jordanian experience with Syrian refugees offers important insights into how large refugee populations affect host country labor markets. Contrary to common fears, the evidence suggests that the massive influx had minimal impact on overall employment rates for Jordanian nationals, though it did create distributional effects that disadvantaged certain groups, particularly other immigrants and vulnerable Jordanians in the informal sector.

The case illustrates the importance of understanding pre-existing labor market structures, recognizing distributional impacts beyond aggregates, and implementing comprehensive policy frameworks that address both formal and informal economic integration. It also highlights how international support can mitigate negative impacts while potentially creating new economic opportunities.

As displacement crises worldwide become increasingly protracted, the Jordanian case offers valuable lessons for developing evidence-based policies that can better manage refugee integration into labor markets while protecting vulnerable host community members.
