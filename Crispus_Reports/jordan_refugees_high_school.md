# The Impact of Syrian Refugees on Jordan's Labor Market: A Study Summary

## What Happened in Jordan?

Since 2011, Syria has been caught in a devastating civil war that forced millions of people to flee their homes. Many of these refugees sought safety in neighboring countries. Jordan, which shares a border with Syria, received an enormous number of refugees. By 2015, approximately 1.3 million Syrians were living in Jordan â€“ a country with only 6.6 million citizens of its own. This means about 1 in 5 people in Jordan was Syrian.

## The Big Question

When a country suddenly receives a large number of refugees, many people worry about how this will affect jobs and wages for the local population. Common concerns include:

- Will locals lose their jobs to refugees who might work for lower wages?
- Will wages decrease because of increased competition for jobs?
- Will certain industries or workers be more affected than others?

Researchers Belal Fallah, Caroline Krafft, and Jackline Wahba set out to answer these questions by studying what actually happened in Jordan after the Syrian refugee influx.

## The Research Approach

The researchers used a clever strategy to understand the impact of the refugee influx:

1. They collected data on Jordanian workers in 2010 (before the Syrian crisis) and again in 2016 (after many Syrians had arrived).

2. They compared changes in employment and wages for Jordanians who lived in areas with many Syrian refugees to those who lived in areas with fewer refugees.

3. They looked at various outcomes including employment rates, unemployment, working hours, wages, and job types.

This approach, called a "difference-in-difference" method, helped them identify whether changes in the Jordanian labor market were actually caused by the refugee influx rather than by other factors.

## What They Found (Surprising Results!)

The results were surprising and challenged many common assumptions about refugee impacts:

### 1. No Overall Negative Effects
**The researchers found that Jordanians living in areas with high concentrations of Syrian refugees did NOT experience worse labor market outcomes than Jordanians living elsewhere.**

This contradicts the common fear that a large influx of refugees automatically leads to job losses or wage decreases for locals.

### 2. Shifts in Types of Employment
While overall employment wasn't harmed, some interesting shifts occurred:
- Jordanians in areas with many refugees were more likely to have formal jobs (with contracts and benefits)
- Some Jordanians moved from private sector to public sector employment
- There was a slight increase in hourly wages (though not in monthly wages)

### 3. Why Weren't There Negative Effects?

The researchers suggest several reasons why the massive refugee influx didn't harm Jordanian workers:

#### Labor Market Structure
- Jordan's labor market was already divided into segments before the crisis
- Jordanians primarily worked in the public sector and formal private sector
- Other immigrants (like Egyptians) dominated the informal sector
- Syrians mainly competed with other immigrants, not with Jordanians

#### Syrian Refugees' Situation
- Syrian refugees had low labor force participation (only 45% of men and 4% of women sought work)
- Until 2016, Syrians weren't legally allowed to work, limiting their impact on formal jobs
- Even after work permits were allowed in 2016, relatively few Syrians obtained them

#### International Aid
- International assistance to help refugees created new jobs and economic activity
- The Jordanian government received aid that helped expand public sector employment
- The "Jordan Compact" of 2016 brought trade benefits and financial support

## Policy Implications: Important Lessons

This research offers important lessons for countries facing refugee influxes:

1. **Refugee impacts depend on context**: The structure of the labor market matters enormously. In Jordan's case, the segmented labor market protected many Jordanians from direct competition.

2. **International support matters**: Aid that creates jobs and economic opportunities can offset potential negative impacts of refugee arrivals.

3. **Legal work opportunities**: Allowing refugees to work legally can be beneficial when properly implemented. It reduces informal work and exploitation while potentially creating economic growth.

4. **Looking beyond averages**: While the overall impact wasn't negative, certain groups (like other immigrants) may have faced more competition. Policy responses should consider these distributional effects.

## Conclusion

The case of Syrian refugees in Jordan challenges the common assumption that refugee influxes automatically harm local workers. Instead, it shows that outcomes depend on the specific context, labor market structures, and policy responses.

For Jordan, the evidence suggests that the massive influx of Syrian refugees did not cause Jordanians to lose jobs or earn lower wages. Instead, it led to some shifts in employment patterns and may have even improved job formality for some workers.

This research reminds us that social and economic outcomes are complex and often defy simple predictions. When making policies about refugees, it's important to rely on evidence rather than assumptions.
